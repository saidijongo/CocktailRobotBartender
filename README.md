# CocktailRobotBartender
In this project I'm making a manless robot to make cocktails in just few seconds. In the JSON file I clarified the recipes of each and every cocktail, including pump assignment for the ingredients. I designed a GUI using TKINTER library in which when a user selects a certain cocktail, pumps relays will be activated accordingly
